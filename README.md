In the BISTU-OPT-SAR dataset, optical and SAR images are resampled to a resolution of 10 m. The pre-processing steps ensure the quality of the data for subsequent analyses and applications. Specific preprocessing steps are described as follows:
1. Optical Image Preprocessing：radiation calibration, atmospheric calibration
2. SAR Image Preprocessing：orbit correction, radiometric correction, noise removal, speckle filtering and terrain correction
